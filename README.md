As a primer subject, this course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS/IT) and its uses at home and work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing hardware, software, network, and communications will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of the study. This class also conducts industry visits and talks as a part of work-based learning. Both industry visits and talks will expose students to a real working environment, get knowledge from the industry, and increase engagement between university and industry. The student also needs to briefly explore the requirements and job specifications for a career in IT.

On 17th November 2023, our class has went to industrial visit to HUAWEI and PETRONAS. Mr. Roman Kvaska and Mr. Ninderjit Singh has open my eyes in how things 'REALLY WORK' in working life in this industry. For example, this industry could be hard for some people therefore we need to manage our time by getting a "me-time" after a long day of work. At HUAWEI, I get to know a lot of new and advanced tech that I've never heard or seen before. I also get to know that HUAWEI sponsored Ideahub at UTMDigital where UTMDigital used it TM Room for video conference and etc.

<summary>Reflection:</summary>
On 22th November 2023, I've done this lab activity along with my groupmates. During activity. the lab technician show us step-by-step on how to assemble and reassemble the CPU. Not to mention that we also get to know the name of each part of the internal component and also the do's and don's on each component. The experience to open up the CPU is very fascinating as this is my maiden to open and look into the internal part of computer hardware. Plus, I get to know the function of every component of the internal component of CPU where this experience is very worth it for a computer science students and hope to get to experience more with more complex device.
