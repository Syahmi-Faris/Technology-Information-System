# Technology and Information System
As a primer subject, this course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS/IT) and its uses at home and work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing hardware, software, network, and communications will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of the study. This class also conducts industry visits and talks as a part of work-based learning. Both industry visits and talks will expose students to a real working environment, get knowledge from the industry, and increase engagement between university and industry. The student also needs to briefly explore the requirements and job specifications for a career in IT.

## Assignment
### [Career Development Talk : Habib & PPG](https://github.com/Syahmi-Faris/Technology-Information-System/blob/main/POSTER/Industry%20Talk%20Habib%20and%20PPG.pdf) 
<details>
<summary>Reflection:</summary>
On 23rd and 28th October 2023, I attended a Career Development Talk presented by alumni of UTM and staff of Pittsburg Plate Glass Company (PPG) which was also alumni of UTM. Habib's talks eventually showed me the importance of e-portfolios and resumes. To hire the top individuals, companies will look at portfolios and resumes for proof of their skills. While listening to PPG's talk, I realized that if a data engineering student wants to be a data engineer, they must strengthen their basic coding and programming skills, such as MySQL and Java, because they will be working with big data later on.

### [Newsletter on Industry Visit : Petronas & Huawei](https://github.com/Syahmi-Faris/Technology-Information-System/blob/main/NEWSLETTER/Industry%20Visit%20Petronas%20and%20Huawei.pdf)
<details>
<summary>Reflection:</summary>
Through the talk given by Mr. Ninderjit Singh, we learned about Petronas's infrastructure services as well as how it uses technology to connect with its clients and other branches around the world. WeÂ learned about Huawei's technologies and how they work in the real world from our visit to the company. With the invention of smart boards, technology not only makes community life more efficient, but also advances education.

###### [PC Assembly (LAB)](https://github.com/Syahmi-Faris/Technology-Information-System/tree/main/PC%20ASSEMBLY)
<details>
<summary>Reflection:</summary>
My classmate and I disassembled and reassembled a PC on November 22, 2023. I learned quite a bit about computer hardware and PC components from this PC lab. We learned how to disassemble and reassemble the PC. We have also been instructed on the proper way to handle each PC component. For instance, to prevent breaking or damaging the RAM, we must grasp its side when removing and reinstalling it.

### [UTM Digital Visit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdpsX1DAgQ4)
<details>
<summary>Reflection:</summary>
On December 13, 2023, my section visited UTM Digital together with the other section. To be honest, I experienced many things during this visit. One of them was that I entered a data center for the first time in my life. I learned how the data is being operated by the database administrator and how often they operate it. We also visited two other locations, Open Office and UTM Digital Care.

<summary>Reflection:</summary>
While completing my design thinking project, I learned many new skills, such as how to deal with people. This skill is very important for students like me because the course I am taking requires me to have skills that can involve and deal with strangers. After all, as we know, in nowadays jobs, we often interact with customers and external individuals for work stuff. Besides that, I also have a better understanding of databases due to my design thinking topic is database systems. I learned how data is monitored by the data admin and some software that they use like Oracle, Power BI, and MySQL.

### [Report on Industry Talk: System Development(Credence)](https://github.com/Syahmi-Faris/Technology-Information-System/blob/main/REPORT/Academic%20Report%20(Credence).pdf)
<details>
<summary>Reflection:</summary>
Credence specializes in the use of software Development of the system, which includes a database and visualization tools, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and programming languages. During this talk, we learned how to develop a system using the System Development Life Cycle, also known as SDLC, a process specifically used in IT projects. The process includes seven phases: planning, analysis, design and prototyping, software development, software testing, implementation and maintenance.
